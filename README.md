# React Friends List App ðŸŒŸ

This repository contains the **Friends List App**, a project from Jonas Schmedtmann's Udemy course: **"Master modern React from beginner to advanced!"**. This project is part of my journey to enhance my React skills by building practical applications that focus on key React concepts.

## About This Project

The Friends List App is one of the earlier projects in the course, designed to help learners practice foundational React concepts while working on a functional application. Key features of this project include:

- **Managing State**: Using `useState` to handle component states for toggling UI elements and managing data.
- **Component Hierarchy**: Building reusable and flexible components like `Button` and `FormAddFriend`.
- **Child-to-Parent Communication**: Learning how to pass data from child components (e.g., adding a friend or splitting a bill).
- **Dynamic UI**: Creating a responsive and interactive user interface to display and update a list of friends.

## Features

- **Add Friends**: Users can add new friends to the list with a name, image, and starting balance.
- **Select Friends**: Highlight a friend from the list to interact with or deselect them.
- **Split Bills**: Calculate and update balances when splitting expenses with a friend.

## Concepts Learned

While working on this project, I practiced and solidified:

- Managing local state with `useState`.
- Passing props between components for dynamic updates.
- Using conditional rendering to toggle UI elements.
- Handling form submissions and validations.

## How to Run

To test the project locally:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-friends-list-app.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd react-friends-list-app
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server:

   ```bash
    npm start
   ```

## Future Improvements

While this app serves as a great introduction to React, potential future enhancements could include:

- Adding persistent storage with `localStorage` or an API backend.
- Implementing advanced features like a search bar or friend removal.
- Exploring additional styling improvements with Tailwind CSS.
